Eureka Server

The discovery server. It contains a registry of services and a REST api that can be used to register a service, deregister a service, and discover the location of other services.

Eureka Service

Any application that can be found in the Eureka Server's registry and is discoverable by others. A service has a logical identifier sometimes called a VIP, sometimes called a "service id", that can refer to one or more instances of the same application.

Eureka Instance

Any application that registers itself with the Eureka Server to be discovered by others

Eureka Client

Any application that can discover services

Questions
How can an application be both a Eureka Instance and a Eureka Client?

Applications often need to make themselves available for use by others (so they are an instance) while at the same time they need to discover other services (so they are a client).

Does a Eureka Client have to be a Eureka Instance?

No. Sometimes an application has nothing to offer and is only a caller of other services. Via configuration (eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false), you can tell it not to register itself as an instance. It is therefore only a Eureka Client as it only discovers other services.
